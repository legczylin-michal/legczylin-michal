## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm first-year student of Data Science at WUT. Here I save my projects so if anyone sees anything worthy, they can use it freely.

Some of them are studies projects, some of them were born by boredom and some of them I created to assist me while playing games)

- Iâ€™m currently studying Cloud Computing, Deep Learning and Advanced Machine Learning
- Calculus and Probability Theory are my two most beloved courses, but not many of my collegues would agree, hehe
- In my freetime I play piano, though occasions due to piano availability are rare
